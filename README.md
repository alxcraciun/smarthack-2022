This is a repo from our first hackathon, hosted by [ASMI](https://smarthack.asmi.ro/).

## Workshops

Before the live event, we had the chance to attended two workshops

## Hackathon

At the 24h Hackathon, the theme was "No-code".

- [We've brainstormed](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPG3sizs=/?share_link_id=442771176824) some start-up ideas using Miro.

- After creating a poll, we've decided to build a cross-platform app to help restaurant owners build their own website. (RestaurUp)

- After some [user feedback](User-Feedback.md), we decided to start working on our [brand identity, logo and interface using Figma.](https://www.figma.com/file/sjMl0kHtiaBreU3SOQuTTi/SmartHack?node-id=14%3A3)

- By the end of the 24h, we've managed to create the [pitch deck for our idea](RestaurUp.pdf) and present our [figma prototype.](https://www.figma.com/proto/sjMl0kHtiaBreU3SOQuTTi/SmartHack?node-id=14%3A5&starting-point-node-id=14%3A5&scaling=scale-down)
